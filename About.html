        <p>Hi, I'm Ruchi Kumari, a B.Com student with a specialization in Accounting Honors. I live in a small town called Kishanganj, near Dangi Basti 🏡. Spending time with my family is something I cherish deeply 👨‍👩‍👧, and I also have a love for fast food 🍕🍔.

            I am an enthusiastic intern and currently serve as an English Council member at NavGurukul 🌱. In this role, I help students improve their English communication skills through various interactive activities and tailored learning methods. I am passionate about creating an engaging and supportive environment that fosters learning and personal growth ✨. My aim is to build confidence in students' speaking and comprehension abilities, and to provide a collaborative space that encourages development.
            
            In my free time, I enjoy singing 🎤 and dancing alone 💃. I’m a simple, soft-hearted person 💖 who believes in kindness and staying true to myself. My current dream is to become a software engineer 💻, and with the guidance and support of NavGurukul, I'm working hard to make that dream a reality 🌟.
