**README**
===============

**Project Overview**
---------------

This project appears to be a simple web page with a JavaScript script that checks whether a number is even or odd.

**Features**
------------

* **Even/Odd Checker**: A JavaScript function that takes a number as input and logs whether it's even or odd to the console.
* **Basic HTML Structure**: An HTML file (`index.html`) that sets up a basic web page with a head, body, and script tag.
* **Script Tag**: A script tag that links to an external JavaScript file (`first.js`).

**Files**
------

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the web page.
* `first.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the even/odd checker function.

**Functionality**
-------------

The even/odd checker function is defined in `first.js` and is called when the script is loaded. It checks whether the number `10` is even or odd and logs the result to the console.

**Future Development**
-------------------

This project is quite basic, and there are many potential features that could be added. Some ideas might include:

* User input: Allow users to input their own numbers to check.
* More complex calculations: Add more advanced mathematical functions to the script.
* Dynamic HTML updates: Use JavaScript to update the HTML content dynamically.

Let me know if you'd like me to add anything else to the README!
